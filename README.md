# ZHCET Club Portal

## Abstract
The ZHCET Club Portal is an Android application designed to connect students and faculty of Zakir Husain College of Engineering and Technology (ZHCET) with various student clubs. The application provides a platform for club authorities to share information about events and activities, ensuring that all students have access to this information.

## Introduction
Student clubs play a significant role in enhancing the overall college experience by offering numerous opportunities for leadership and participation beyond the classroom. However, disseminating information about club activities often faces challenges. The ZHCET Club Portal aims to bridge this gap by providing a centralized virtual platform for all club-related information.

## Project Design and Implementation
The application is developed using Android Studio, with Java for implementing functionality and XML for designing the user interface. Firebase is used as the backend database. Key features of the application include:
